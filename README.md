**Machine Learning Algorithms (from Scratch)**

*This repository contains implementations of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for visualizations.
The goal is to deeply understand how these algorithms work internally, implementing every algorithm from mathametical derivations step by step, without relying on high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn.*

🚀 **Implemented Algorithms**

~Linear Regression (Gradient Descent & Normal Equation)

~Ridge Regression

~Lasso Regression(cordinate descent)

~k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

~Decision Trees

~Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

~Clustering (K-Means)

(More algorithms will be added as I continue learning!)

**📊 Visualizations**

Each notebook includes visualizations to  understand the behavior of the algorithms (decision boundaries, regression lines, clusters, etc.).

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

@Python

@NumPy

@Matplotlib

@Jupyter Notebook

**📌 Future Work**

I will be adding more algorithms as i learn.
